# ac3airborne-intake

This repository contains an [intake](https://github.com/intake/intake) catalogue for acessing data from the [AC3](http://www.ac3-tr.de/) airborne field campaigns. To make use of the catalogue, it is best to start with the [pyac3airborne](https://github.com/igmk/pyac3airborne) package, which is the main entry point to the data and to study the [pyac3airborne_book](https://igmk.github.io/pyac3airborne_book/intro.html), which is a description of most of the data and a collection of examples and tools. 

The data is stored currently exclusively at the [Institute for Geophysics and Meteorology](http://www.geomet.uni-koeln.de) on the [webserver](https://atmos.meteo.uni-koeln.de/).
